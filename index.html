              As a compassionate female student who truly cares about the
              well-being of others, I'm running for Welfare Secretary to be a
              voice and a support system for every student. I believe no one
              should be left behind whether it's in times of need, stress, or
              struggle.

              than a position for me it is a responsibility I am ready to
              embrace with an open heart and a determined spirit.
